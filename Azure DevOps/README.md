# Azure DevOps Demo

Azure DevOps provides developer services for support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications.

## Key Concepts for Interviews

- **Azure Boards**: Agile tools for planning and tracking work (Sprints, Backlogs, Kanban boards).
- **Azure Repos**: Private Git repositories.
- **Azure Pipelines**: CI/CD that works with any language, platform, and cloud.
    - **Build Pipeline (CI)**: Compiles code, runs tests, creates artifacts.
    - **Release Pipeline (CD)**: Deploys artifacts to environments.
- **Azure Artifacts**: Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven).
- **Variable Groups**: Shared sets of variables for pipelines.
- **Service Connections**: Securely connect to external services (like Azure Subscription) from pipelines.

## Included Demos

1. **azure-pipelines.yml**: Multi-stage YAML pipeline for a .NET application.
2. **README.md**: Detailed breakdown of DevOps practices and interview questions.
